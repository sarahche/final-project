		<p class = "project-description"> The Jewish Association on Aging is a Pittsburgh-based senior care facility that aims to provide services and support members of the Pittsburgh community affected by dementia, Alzheimer's, and other memory problems; our goal was to ideate and explore the ways that we can enhance the lives of the JAA's residents. Then with our proposal, we designed a poster to describe and advertise our idea. We presented the final proposal and poster design to a number of JAA's staff members. </p>

		<!-- Step 1 -->
		<div class = "container-sm col-sm-4 step-num"> <span class = "numbering">01 </span> Research
		</div>
		<div class = "container-sm col-sm-8 desc"> My first visit to the JAA was a tour and deep-dive of the facilities and services that they offered. There are day services that members can attend while their family members are at work, hospice facilities for residents with physical difficulties, and long-term facilities for residents with cognitive impairments.
		For our resident interviews, we were careful to formulate simple and direct questions that would be easier to answer.
		</div>
		<!-- Step 2 -->
		<div class = "container-sm col-sm-4 step-num"> <span class = "numbering">02 </span> Topic
		</div>
		<div class = "container-sm col-sm-8 desc"> After gathering our research, we went through ways that we could encourage the residents to engage in different activities that would enrich their experience at the JAA.

		From personal observation and multiple staff and resident interviews over multiple trips to the JAA, we concluded that there was an emphasis on light and space. We wanted to focus on a way to give residents a sense of freedom that went beyond the JAA's walls.  
		</div>
		<!-- Step 3 -->
		<div class = "container-sm col-sm-4 step-num"> <span class = "numbering">03 </span> Storyboard
		</div>
		<div class = "container-sm col-sm-8 desc"> With a desired experience in hand, we illustrated the step-by-step process that a user would take to enjoy VR, starting from its introduction to the JAA's residents to its usage. By illustrating each step in the process from beginning to end, we mapped out a user's entire experience.

		<!-- Step 4 -->
		<div class = "container-sm col-sm-4 step-num"> <span class = "numbering">04 </span> Iteration
		</div>
		<div class = "container-sm col-sm-8 desc"> We explored a number of different color palettes we could utilize for our poster design. With a VR concept, we emphasized a dreamlike escape from reality. We wanted to make it clear to a viewer what the subject for the proposal was at first glance and to use the steps from the storyboard to illustrate the process of its use.

		</div>
		<div class = "container-sm col-sm-8 desc"> Rather than keeping our original name "Dreamscape", we shifted to our new name "EnvisionVR" to truly drive home the subject of our proposal â€” even the name alone should be enough to the subject of our proposal. During our final presentation to JAA staff members, we walked through the context, problem, and our proposed solution.
